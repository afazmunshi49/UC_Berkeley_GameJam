# UC_Berkeley_GameJam - Apple Monster
This Game was made in a 48 hour game jam.

### About
There are some apples on the field and you as a player have to collect all the apples before the Monster catches you. The Monster will follow the player anywhere it goes. The twist in the game is that there are 10 apples on the ground and 2 out of 10 apples are poisoned (all the apples look alike), i.e; after eating them the playerâ€™s speed will decreases and so the difficulty of the game increases. Once the player has collected all the apples, then he can enter the hut at the top left corner of the screen. Now the player has entered a new world where he will solve a puzzle. There is a hidden medicine on the map, the player will find it and click on it to win the game, but be aware that the monster will still follow you while solving the puzzle.
